Assignment #1


1. Create a Hello World application, that would accept your name as a command-line argument and print "Hello XXX, Welcome to the world of Scala" on the console.


2. Implement a function "def factorial(x:Int)" for computing the factorial of a number that should work in the range x=[0,20]


3. In scala, Range(a,b) generates a Range 'a' until 'b'.  You can run the "map" operator on Range.  Now, use Range, map and the factorial function to print the factorials values for 0 to 20 as a table, where the first column is 'x' and 2nd column is "x!".


4. Repeat (3), but construct the factorial function as a lambda function.


5. In scala, String.split(" ") tokenizes a large string into an Array of independent tokens.  Create a function that accepts a string as an input argument and returns a Map[String, Int], where the tuples are <unique_string, count>.
